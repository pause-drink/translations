# Notes for the Greek translation

### 2019-06-20 (tdiam)

Some guidelines I've decided to follow:
* There's no neutral gender in Greek, so I'm using the male.
* I'm omitting diacritics when the text is uppercased in the UI (e.g. `game.click_reveal` in `ui-greek.json`). It's the common way to present Greek text in UIs.
* I'm translating/transliterating) English proper nouns to Greek, only when the English version is AFAIK uncommon (e.g. `Charles Darwin` -> `Κάρολος Δαρβίνος` but not `Donald Trump` -> `Ντόναλντ Τραμπ`).
* When thinking of replacing a foreign public figure with a Greek one:  
    * Is the foreign one relatively unknown in Greece (rare mentions in Greek media, only a few paragraphs in their Greek Wikipedia page)?
    * Do they belong to similar categories (e.g. singers)? The balance should be maintained between the English and Greek translations.
    * Will this make the game more enjoyable for everyone?
* Same goes for the songs, movies and series.
* For the impersonations, I've chosen people that are commonly impersonated by Greek comedians (Mitsikostas, Lianos, Tsouvelas).
* For the accents, I've chosen those that are most commonly used in prank calls or stereotypical sketches.
